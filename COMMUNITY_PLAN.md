Describe the plan to support the community
Some Tron will go back into people holding Tron and into hardware capacity for Testnet, future Betanet and of course Mainnet. Up and above that I will act as Tron ambassador for Africa continent and will push a lot of content via these methods:

YouTube videos – I create YouTube videos illustrating how to do things. These how to videos cover simple things like how to buy Tron, setup SR nodes, develop on Tron, etc.
Medium Posts – Similar info but text based version of YouTube videos
Twitter – Push out the content to broader community
Reddit - Push out the content to broader community
